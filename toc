- strings
- functions
- records with one field
- records with two fields
- tuples
- constructors with fields
- they are all cartesian products

- enumeration (role)
- sum types with fields

- this is a powerful tool for modeling data

- refactorability
- safety

- common pattern:
  constructors with one field that is a record type
